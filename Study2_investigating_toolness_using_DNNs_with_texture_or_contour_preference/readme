We utilize 3 types of ResNet-50. 
They have the totally same structure, but have different training materials, so they have different bias. 

The first one(IN) is trained based on ImageNet, and it is regarded to have texture bias. 
The second one(SIN) is trained based on stylized imagenet, and it is regarded to have texture bias. 
The final one(SININ) is trained based on both of them, and it have dual bias.

In this folder I would only present the coding example of IN, codes of the other two model are the same as this one.
